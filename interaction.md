# Adaptive Learning Platform - Interaction Design

## Core Learning Loop
The application centers around a personalized learning experience where students interact with AI-powered mathematics problems that adapt to their skill level in real-time.

### Primary Learning Interface
- **Problem Presentation**: Students see mathematical problems displayed with clear typography and visual aids
- **Multiple Input Methods**: Support for numerical answers, multiple choice, and step-by-step solutions
- **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate validation with encouraging messages and detailed explanations
- **Hint System**: Progressive hints available on demand, from subtle clues to complete solutions
- **Difficulty Adaptation**: Problems automatically adjust difficulty based on performance history

### Adaptive Learning Engine
- **Student Modeling**: Tracks mastery levels across different mathematical topics (algebra, geometry, arithmetic)
- **Performance Analytics**: Maintains detailed history of attempts, success rates, and learning patterns
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Suggests practice areas and provides personalized learning paths
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and achievement systems to maintain engagement
